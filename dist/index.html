              We provide structured lessons to optimize students&#39 learning
              opportunity. Our program is centered around a communicative
              approach with focused study balanced with communicative study. Our
              courses are catered to the students&#39 needs or the company&#39s
              targets. Being on site also gives me the opportunity to work
              closely with the students to adjust the schedules to everyone&#39s
              convenience while facilitating their natural English. On top of
              these benefits of having a language influencer on site I am also
              able to lend an international atmosphere to the office as well as
              engage students in natural settings, for instance at the copy
              machine or over Line. On top of this companies can avoid problems
              caused by technical issues during online lessons.

            <h3>Corporate English Lessons</h3>
            <p>
              Just as every organization is unique in the way it does business, 
              the language training program that each corporation requires needs 
              to be tailor-made. Drawing on a long history of working with companies, 
              I am equipped to work together with our customers to make sure the 
              key areas of need are addressed. Meetings, presentations, description 
              of production process, preparation for overseas transfer and business 
              trips are some areas in which my experience means that I can address 
              these vital skills head on.

              Working to step up your staff&#39s TOEIC levels? We can work together 
              through skill practice, advice and practical exercises designed to 
              build on grammar, vocabulary and listening skills that are important 
              for improving your TOEIC ability. The best balance of self-study and 
              review with a focused practice with your teacher can help you fulfill 
              your test targets.

            I am a dedicated and experienced instructor, holding punctuality and diligence as 
            important in conducting all aspects of the English classes. That being said, students grow 
            by enjoyment of English and we ensure that the balance we set in class fosters this. 
            There has been a trend towards more online study recently which has advantages but also holds 
            some disadvantages and drop off in quality. Getting back into a classroom with an 
            immersive teaching environment opens a more 3-D and interconnected approach to study. 
            I have experience of over 18 years teaching chiefly business English including many 
            Hamamatsu area musical instrument makers and automotive industry companies. My recent 
            inside-company experience of four and a half years plus working in sales has given me 
            more insight into the areas that need to be taught which helps me approach each class 
            even more professionally.
